## Hi, I'm Kevin ✏️
I'm currently a student at UH Manoa, but I aspire to work in data analytics and use my background in Mathematics and Economics. 
I am interested in Machine Learning and Causal Inference, generally applying heterodox methodological approaches to data problems.
However, this GitHub will not only be for those things (if I ever refer to those projects, I will include a hyperlink). 
Alongside my professional interests, I intend on getting into software development and contributing to the open source community.
